Commands
======
For the commands, I will be using the prefix `shock.`, please note yours will be whatever it is in config.json :)
- shock.ticket - "Please create a ticket, this enables us to help you further. You can login to the client area at: https://shockbyte.com/billing/clientarea.php and can then open a ticket at: https://shockbyte.com/billing/submitticket.php"
- shock.dedi - "A dedicated IP is an IP that is reserved for only one server and isn't shared with others. This means is that you can use the default Minecraft port of 25565, which will allow you to only enter the IP without the trailing :port number to connect to your server. If you have a URL redirect (DNS Record), it also means you won't have to append the port after the URL to join your server. This allows your server to appear more professional and is easier to memorize and join."
- shock.log - "Please post your `latest.log` to https://hastebin.com so we can see the problem :)"
- shock.notsupport - "This server is not designed to be used for support and isn't one of our official support options. If you need assistance, please contact us at: https://shockbyte.com/billing/submitticket.php"
- shock.refund - "Simply open a support ticket (https://shockbyte.com/billing/submitticket.php) asking for a refund, please make sure you are with in the 24 hour refund period, otherwise you might not be eligible for a refund."
